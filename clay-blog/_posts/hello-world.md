# Clayton Ortiz

I am Clayton Ortiz, the creator, curator, and writer for clay-blog. I am creating this blog to learn some new skills and to give myself a place to write
about the things I am learning. Through reading the blogs of others I have seen it talked about how writing a blog about something you have learned to teach
others is a great way to commit that thing to memory. That makes sense to me and so I hope to try and write a simple blog post once a week on some new technology
or skill that I have picked up that week. Primarily I will focus on web development and software engineering in my writings. Some things I want to learn or improve
on in the immediate time period are:

    - Algorithims and Data Structures
    - Networks and Routing
    - Cloud Computing
    - Javascript and Go programming languages
    - CSS and UI

So basically I want to learn a lot about a lot. We will see how this goes, hopefully I stick to it and am able to look back on this blog years down the road and 
see how much I have improved in betch technical skill and writing ability. Also, I do not actually plan for many people to read these blogs but I will try to make them proffesional-ish.
